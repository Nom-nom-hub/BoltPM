# BoltPM Development Plan (Status: âœ… = Done, ðŸŸ§ = In Progress, ðŸ•’ = Future)

## What's Done
- Deterministic, CWD-agnostic plugin loading and output paths (always workspace-root relative)
- Robust plugin lifecycle integration tests (success and failure cases)
- Serial test execution using `serial_test` to avoid race conditions
- Enhanced debug logging for plugin loading, exit codes, and errors
- All major CLI, registry, GUI, and plugin system features implemented and tested
- Unified, public, and serializable `PluginContext` for consistent plugin communication

## What's Left To Do
- WASM plugin support ðŸŸ§
- Remote plugin marketplace ðŸ•’
- GUI auto-update packages ðŸ•’
- Package audit logs & trust levels ðŸ•’
- Further test isolation (unique plugin dirs per test) if needed

## Overview
BoltPM is a fast, modern, cross-platform NPM alternative written in Rust. It consists of a production-quality CLI, a real-time GUI frontend, a self-hosted private registry, and a dynamic plugin system for install hooks.

## Lockfile (`bolt.lock`)

BoltPM uses a JSON lockfile (`bolt.lock`) to ensure deterministic installs. The lockfile records the exact version, resolved tarball URL, and dependency tree for every installed package. This guarantees that repeated installs produce the same dependency graph, even if newer versions are published.

Example format:
```json
{
  "packages": {
    "foo": {
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "resolved": "http://localhost:4000/v1/foo/1.2.3/",
      "dependencies": {
        "bar": "2.0.0"
      }
    },
    "bar": {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "resolved": "http://localhost:4000/v1/bar/2.0.0/",
      "dependencies": {}
    }
  }
}
On install, BoltPM will use bolt.lock to pin versions if present.
On update, the lockfile is refreshed.
On remove, entries are deleted from the lockfile.
If bolt.lock and package.json are out of sync, BoltPM will warn or error (with --frozen-lockfile).
